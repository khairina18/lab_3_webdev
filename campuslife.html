        <p>The first picture is my classmates aka my groupmates, while
            the second picture is my roomates that I love so much! 
            These are the ones that I am very grateful because they
            will always be by myside and help me out through my ups and downs.
            A moment with them never gets bored and always be my favourite
            memory through my whole teenage years.</p>

        <h2>First-time Hiking</h2>
        <img src="hiking.jpg">
        <img src="puncak.jpg">
        <p>I just wanted to share my first ever experience hiking with
            my friends. Actually, we have a group project that we need 
            do documentation and we decided to go to Bukit Botak, Bukit Berdiri
            and Bukit Payong at Parit Sulong, Batu Pahat, Johor. There were
            five of my friends who already know the hiking trails, so we just
            follow them and these three hills are connected with each other. 
            The trail is not a beginner friendly but it was very fun to try
            it and I would definitely go with my friends again.
            The view on top of the hill is breathtaking and stunning! Not
            even in camera lens that could capture how beautiful the view was.
            I am very grateful to my team members who would always wait for me
            and help me whenever I am having difficulties. This 
            is because I actually have asthma and that explains why I never get
            the chance to experience doing extreme activity before this.</p>

        <h2>Colour Run UTHM 2023</h2>

        <img src="run.jpg">
        <p>I also participated in a marathon called Colour Run UTHM 2023.
            It is such a wonderful experience and it is also the first
            marathon that I ever finished in my whole life. It is 10km.
            I participated with my roomates. It is a very tiring yet fun 
            experience. We did not get the top 10 places but we did finish 
            it together. One of my achievement that I am proud of and I
            am really glad that I join this marathon.
